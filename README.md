The course will cover data management and analytics for businesses using various big data
technologies, such as NoSQL databases, distributed file systems, MapReduce, and Spark.


By the end of this course, students will:

**• Reinforce Foundational Knowledge**: Review and strengthen their understanding
of SQL and relational database management systems (RDBMS), essential for bridging
traditional data management with modern big data techniques.

**• Master Command Line Proficiency**: Develop competence in basic terminal and
shell commands, which are crucial for interacting with big data platforms and managing
cloud-based infrastructure.

**• Implement Version Control**: Gain proficiency in version control and collaboration
tools, particularly Git and GitHub, to manage code and collaborate effectively in data-
driven projects.

**• Explore Data Scaling Techniques**: Understand the principles of vertical and hor-
izontal scaling and how they apply to both traditional RDBMS and modern big data
systems.

**• Evaluate and Implement NoSQL Solutions**: Learn to identify the need for NoSQL
and non-relational database systems in handling unstructured and semi-structured data,
and how to implement these systems effectively.

**• Analyze Big Data Ecosystems**: Identify and understand the various components
that comprise the big data technology stack, including storage, processing, and analytics
platforms.

**• Apply Big Data Technologies**: Design and develop advanced analytics applications
on big data platforms, leveraging technologies like Hadoop and Spark to process and
analyze large datasets.

**• Develop Scalable Solutions**: Apply the knowledge of big data technologies to cre-
ate and scale analytics applications that can handle massive datasets, optimizing for
performance and efficiency in business environments.
