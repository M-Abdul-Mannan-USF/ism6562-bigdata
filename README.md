The course will cover data management and analytics for businesses using various big data
technologies, such as NoSQL databases, distributed file systems, MapReduce, and Spark.

In our increasingly connected world, the sheer volume of data produced by social media, Internet of Things (IoT) sensors, and countless digital platforms has fundamentally transformed how businesses operate. Companies today must manage enormous quantities of information—often reaching petabytes or more—which demands innovative technologies and methodologies to transform raw data into meaningful strategic insights. Conventional database systems and analysis methods, while once highly effective, are no longer adequate for organizations aiming to extract valuable intelligence from such extensive datasets.
This course aims to provide students with the expertise and practical abilities needed to handle, process, and examine large-scale data using contemporary big data technologies. Participants will develop hands-on proficiency with the tools and platforms that empower data-driven decision-making across industry-leading companies. The curriculum is organized into two major sections. The first section explores big data storage solutions, covering NoSQL databases and distributed architectures necessary for handling enormous volumes of unstructured and semi-structured information. The second section examines big data processing platforms, offering comprehensive coverage of Hadoop, MapReduce, and Spark—critical technologies for analyzing massive datasets efficiently. Students will complete practical assignments that mirror real-world challenges, enabling them to create and deploy scalable big data systems within a business environment.


By the end of this course, students will:

**• Reinforce Foundational Knowledge**: Review and strengthen their understanding
of SQL and relational database management systems (RDBMS), essential for bridging
traditional data management with modern big data techniques.

**• Master Command Line Proficiency**: Develop competence in basic terminal and
shell commands, which are crucial for interacting with big data platforms and managing
cloud-based infrastructure.

**• Implement Version Control**: Gain proficiency in version control and collaboration
tools, particularly Git and GitHub, to manage code and collaborate effectively in data-
driven projects.

**• Explore Data Scaling Techniques**: Understand the principles of vertical and hor-
izontal scaling and how they apply to both traditional RDBMS and modern big data
systems.

**• Evaluate and Implement NoSQL Solutions**: Learn to identify the need for NoSQL
and non-relational database systems in handling unstructured and semi-structured data,
and how to implement these systems effectively.

**• Analyze Big Data Ecosystems**: Identify and understand the various components
that comprise the big data technology stack, including storage, processing, and analytics
platforms.

**• Apply Big Data Technologies**: Design and develop advanced analytics applications
on big data platforms, leveraging technologies like Hadoop and Spark to process and
analyze large datasets.

**• Develop Scalable Solutions**: Apply the knowledge of big data technologies to cre-
ate and scale analytics applications that can handle massive datasets, optimizing for
performance and efficiency in business environments.
